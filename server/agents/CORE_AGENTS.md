# Core Sub-Agent Types - ParentPilot.AI

This document outlines the core sub-agent types implemented in the ParentPilot.AI system. Each agent specializes in specific aspects of child development and parenting support.

## Overview

The ParentPilot.AI system uses a multi-agent architecture where specialized sub-agents work together to provide comprehensive parenting support. Each agent extends the `BaseAgent` class and implements specific capabilities for their domain.

## Agent Architecture

### Base Agent Class
All sub-agents inherit from `BaseAgent` which provides:
- Common data access methods
- AI communication capabilities
- Task and insight management
- Database integration
- Conversation logging

### Core Capabilities
Each agent implements:
- `processMessage()` - Handle user interactions
- `generateInsights()` - Create domain-specific insights
- `generateRecommendations()` - Provide actionable recommendations
- `executeTask()` - Perform specific tasks
- `initializeCapabilities()` - Define agent capabilities

## Agent Integration

### Agent Factory
The `SubAgentFactory` manages agent creation and type mapping:

```typescript
// Agent type mapping
switch (agentType.name.toLowerCase()) {
  case 'development tracker':
    return new DevelopmentTrackerAgent(agent, context);
  case 'learning coach':
    return new LearningCoachAgent(agent, context);
  case 'behavior analyst':
    return new BehaviorAnalystAgent(agent, context);
  case 'social skills mentor':
    return new SocialSkillsMentorAgent(agent, context);
  case 'academic advisor':
    return new AcademicAdvisorAgent(agent, context);
}
```

### Cross-Agent Collaboration
Agents can collaborate through:
- Shared database access
- Inter-agent communication
- Coordinated task execution
- Combined insights and recommendations

## Data Flow

### Input Processing
1. User message received
2. Agent type determined
3. Appropriate agent instantiated
4. Message processed with domain-specific context
5. AI response generated
6. Conversation logged

### Insight Generation
1. Child data retrieved
2. Domain-specific analysis performed
3. Insights created and stored
4. Recommendations generated
5. Results returned to user

### Task Execution
1. Task type identified
2. Agent-specific task handler called
3. Analysis and recommendations generated
4. Task status updated
5. Results stored in database

## Agent Capabilities

Each agent defines specific capabilities:

```typescript
initializeCapabilities(): AgentCapability[] {
  return [
    {
      name: 'capability_name',
      description: 'Description of capability',
      enabled: true
    }
  ];
}
```

## Database Integration

All agents integrate with the database through:
- `AgentTask` - Task management
- `AgentInsight` - Insight storage
- `AgentRecommendation` - Recommendation tracking
- `AgentConversation` - Conversation logging
- `AgentLearningData` - Learning data storage

## Future Agent Types

Planned additional agent types:
- **Health Monitor Agent** - Physical health and wellness tracking
- **Creative Catalyst Agent** - Creative development and artistic expression
- **Technology Guide Agent** - Digital literacy and technology use
- **Family Dynamics Agent** - Family relationship and communication support

## Best Practices

### Agent Development
1. Extend `BaseAgent` class
2. Implement all required abstract methods
3. Define specific capabilities
4. Use domain-specific prompts
5. Handle errors gracefully
6. Log all activities

### Prompt Engineering
1. Include child context in prompts
2. Use age-appropriate language
